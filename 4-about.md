  <p>Andrei is a meticulous, story driven cinematographer based in London.
  Following a lifelong obsession with the moving image kindled during his youth by unadulterated consumption of 90's Romanian cable TV, he studied Film Editing & Sound at the National Film and Theatre University “I.L. Caragiale” where he graduated with honours. During his studies, he developed a keen interest in cinematography and started experimenting with form to find his own take on the medium.</p>

  <p>Why 90’s cable TV? What makes it special?
  Growing up in the cultural tapestry that is the shore of the Black Sea, Andrei was inspired to seek out an eclectic array of artistic movements, being equally fond of the works of Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman and Sergei Parajanov  on one hand and Terry Gilliam, Ridley Scott and Mike Leigh on the other: filmmakers who seem to have little in common yet somehow manage to put on screen our common humanity.</p>

  <p>Andrei's approach to life and filmmaking is practically indistinguishable in its complete dedication and attention to detail. This has led to his work being screened around the world, garnering multiple awards thanks to tightly-knit relationships with his collaborators and a continuous drive to render the extraordinary in the mundane, the engaging moments in day-to-day life.</p>
